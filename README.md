This is a play gorund for Aura Project for PHP. An experimental Vendor.Package.

Hari.Contact tries to incorporate different rendering engines like PHP, Twig, Mustache, Dwoo, Smarty, Latte etc to Aura Framework.

Dependencies :
This package has dependencies.

Hari.Blog ( which contains the layouts, one layout from different packages :-) )

Zend Framework1 Form component . Any packages which are PSR-0 are compatible with Aura Framework :-).

I will be adding more independent packages like KnpMenu removing the static menu when I get free time.

Fork the packages and play with it.

Note : For the rendering to work, you need to use the below packages

https://github.com/harikt/Aura.Framework/tree/render
https://github.com/harikt/Aura.Web/tree/render

The master on https://github.com/auraphp will not work with this Hari.Blog or Hari.Contact packages.

Feel free to ask any queries at irc channel( freenode.net ) of #auraphp or shoot a tweet @harikt . I will try to solve if I can.

Thanks
